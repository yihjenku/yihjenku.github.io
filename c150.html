				<h3>July 5th, 2016</h3>
				<p>
					This past Friday, I raced with Columbia lightweight rowing for the final time. I never imagined that joining C150 could have shaped me and my college years the way it did, because being a coxswain for such an amazing team has taught me more about myself than anything else. While I am incredibly sad that my time with the team has ended, I am even more proud of what we have accomplished over the course of the past four years, culminating in Columbia’s first national championship in lightweight rowing.
				</p>
				<p>
					What I am most grateful for, however, is the people with whom I was able to share my senior season. These nine individuals have a hold on me in a way that no one else does: because of them, I have been able to do so much more than I ever thought I was capable. They judged me to be powerful as a result of my character and not my physical strength. They allowed me to lead without knowing whether it was toward victory or defeat. And, most importantly, they included me in something so special in spite of my differences, which was something I never realized I needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a small gift to them, I’ve put together a series of portraits from our final trip as a group. Each picture depicts how I will always remember that particular individual and an explanation of what he means to me personally. Take a look and be impressed by them for who they are just as much as I am, not to mention they’re a pretty good-looking group, so there’s that too.
				</p>	
				<p>
					Thank you to the boys of Columbia Lightweight Rowing’s 2016 Varsity Eight and to the rest of C150 for an incredible ride. Special shoutouts to Jesse Foglia, Jakub Buczek, Bella Pascal Zionts, and Hannah Cashen for supporting me through the season- onto the next chapter! #FYY #TFE #C150orDie

				<h3>John Maloney</h3>
				<h4>Seat: Bow</h4>
				<p>
					This is John, and he is a secret diva. People don’t know this upon first meeting him, but John low-key loves attention and is a master manipulator. In his own words, he is also “influential and a trendsetter”. Sorry to blow your cover, John, but to be fair I love this photo of you and I’m sure you like it too because you can’t see anything but yourself. 
				</p>
				<p>
					All jokes aside, John has taught me so much about internal exploration. He’s shown me that it’s a wonderful thing to be an introvert and that it’s okay to not ever be quite sure of who you are or who you want to be. I am also someone who is constantly anxious, and John is one of the only people I know who worries with me rather than telling me not to worry at all. He understands that studying/rowing at Columbia is very much a privilege and not a right, and he never feels content enough to stop working toward something better. He considers other people’s perspectives and keeps an open mind, something which a lot of people can learn from. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Not to mention I can always count on him to belt out a pop song for me in a pinch. Now that’s true friendship.

				<h3>Oliver Ingram</h3>
				<h4>Seat: 2</h4>
				<p>
					This is Twist, more formally known as Oliver, and I only need two words to describe him: beautifully insane. Yes, he looks pretty sinister in this photo, but when you get to know Twist you learn that he is a kind and free soul. He hates it when people tell him what to do (which is ironic given our coxswain-rower relationship) and he despises people who are always on their phone (another irony with me), but I guess the latter is a joke on me because now I wish I had spent more time hanging out with him the last four years.
				</p>
				<p>
					I love it when he asks me random questions about Pokemon strategy and I love that he started reading the Wall Street Journal this year to become better informed about the world (something which I admittedly lack). I love seeing what he decides to do with his hair and what he wears because all of his decisions seem to be the exact opposite of what I would choose, but in the end I always end up jealous of his look. If there’s someone whose aesthetic I envy, it is Twist. Keep doing you bud.

				<h3>Jeffrey Monahan</h3>
				<h4>Seat: 3</h4>
				<p>
					This is Jeff, and here he can be seen in his natural position: laying down and watching videos on YouTube and/or reading manga on his phone. Most people would probably describe Jeff as a ridiculous person because of his loud laugh or his inability to tell a concise anecdote. He has a hard time remembering names when he meets people and sometimes he doesn’t even realize that people are talking to him. One time, a girl asked him out and he missed it because he wasn’t paying attention. Looks like he missed out on the love of his life too. 
				</p>
				<p>
					But the funny thing is that Jeff is actually a great listener when you need him to be and is always willing to offer you advice. His ability to empathize with others is admirable, and I hope he knows how much I’ve valued his friendship the past couple of years. He knows when to laugh at himself and when he needs to take himself seriously. Jeff stepped up and became one of the top rowers on the team even when other people doubted him. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Oh, and he’s a huge nerd like me. Jeff’s dating profile would most likely be along the lines of “Plays League of Legends. Watches anime. Studies computer science. Rows occasionally.”

				<h3>Colin Ross</h3>
				<h4>Seat: 4</h4>
				<p>
					This is Colin, and he is very competitive. But then again so am I, and I’ve been very lucky to have had him as a friend and motivator the past four years. Of all the people in the boat, I feel like he’s the most OG, just because he’s the person in my year that I’ve shared the most time with on the water. Together our sophomore year, we won Eastern Sprints in the second varsity and moved into the varsity for IRAs where we earned bronze; we capped off our senior year with a decisive victory in the same event to become national champs.
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s really easy to continue bragging about Colin given his credentials both academically and athletically, but rather than listing them all for you (as much as Colin would love for me to do so), I’ll instead share why I’ve been a little jealous of Colin since I met him: Colin has known what he’s wanted to do and who he’s wanted to be for years, and that to me is the most impressive thing about him. He has specific goals for the future and I’ve watched him take concrete steps to get to them. Combine that with a little (read: a lot of) cockiness and some charm and he is good to go!
				</p>
				<p>
					Best of luck at Oxford next year tacking yet another accomplishment onto your CV. Is it a graduate degree in art that separates you from being just another artsy hipster? Just kidding. If there was someone who I am certain will be successful in his career of choice, it would be you, and I’ll do my best to keep up. I’ll see you at your first exhibition as chief curator.

				<h3>William Solberg</h3>
				<h4>Seat: 5</h4>
				<p>
					This is Will, and he hates this picture, but it was taking this photo that inspired me to do this series in the first place. I guess from his perspective it’s a pretty crappy depiction of who he is: he’s shirtless in our hostel with his stuff everywhere and he’s pouring protein powder into a plastic bottle because he’s just finished working out. But the thing is that this is exactly who he is, and I respect the shit out of him for it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Will is messy and forgetful. The best stories often involve friends or strangers miraculously stumbling upon his passport, debit/credit cards, keys, or IDs on the street and returning them to him. Witnessing how quickly he can conquer a table or room by strewing his possessions across the area is downright amazing. Needless to say, we give him a lot of crap for it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					But I have a theory that all this happens as a result of how dedicated and focused he is to his craft; when you have that much commitment to something, everything else falls flat. Will redefined for me what it means to be a hard-working athlete and, more significantly in his case, a patient individual. No one else deserved a national title more than this guy after having to wait years to be eligible to race and no one else is as supportive when you need someone to lift you back up. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Don’t worry, Will. You may not like this photo, but to me it represents all your best qualities, not to mention that your shoulder/arm look pretty damn good in it too. I’ll post the “better” pictures of you soon.

		<div class="text" id="Jenson">
			<div class="scrim">
				<h3>Jenson Carlgren</h3>
				<h4>Seat: 6</h4>
				<p>
					This is Jenson and I f***ing hate how annoying he is, or at least that’s what I tell him every time he bothers me. Truthfully it’s actually quite endearing how much he tries to take care of me, whether it’s observing that I haven’t eaten enough, making up a new Spanish nickname for me (“y griega jota”, which literally means “YJ” in Spanish, in case you’re wondering), or fixing my posture when I’m slouching. And I suppose it’s safe to say that I’m going to miss him very much. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As the only freshman in the varsity sitting in a rather critical seat, Jenson never let the pressure get to him even when things got a little rough. He upholds himself to a high expectation while still maintaining a calm exterior and I could always count on him to kill it on race day. I’m envious of Jenson because he gets to be on the team for three more years when Columbia lightweight rowing is just getting started. You could tell when he arrived at Columbia that he came with the intention of being the best, and I can’t wait to see what he does in the future. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You can extrapolate for yourself why the picture of Jenson is him in front of a mirror.

				<h3>David Mottola</h3>
				<h4>Seat: 7</h4>
				<p>
					This is David, and I say “David” rather than “Dave” because otherwise his mother would kill me. In this photo, David is walking to practice at Henley and he is early (to no one’s surprise on the planet). This picture to me is a perfect embodiment of his intensity as a person: David is often grumpy, grumbly, and critical (unless he’s talking to a stranger, to whom he is surprisingly light and pleasant), but it’s these traits that make everyone around him better and more accountable. When I think I might be late to practice, it’s not the coaches’ reactions that worry me the most. Having a bad row on the water or not giving your best effort? David will notice, because he gives it his all every damn day and expects you to do the same. I am certain that I became a better coxswain because of him.
				</p>
				<p>
					David will forever hold a special place in my memory because he was with me in the varsity the longest. We both remember how uncertain it feels going into a competition as true underdogs and how amazing it feels to overcome expectations. All in all we medalled together five times. He was the only rising senior in the varsity this year, and I’m truly looking forward to how he leads the team next year to an even more successful season. 
				</p>
				<p>
					But outside of rowing, I think what I’m going to miss the most are the times when David takes me by surprise, like when he asks about my personal life or admits to his love of watching astrophysics and Star Wars videos on YouTube. When he cares about something or someone, you’ll see it, and for that I will always be grateful.

				<h3>Benjamin Landis</h3>
				<h4>Seat: Stroke</h4>
				<p>
					This is Ben, and he is hands down one of my favorite people. Getting to sit face-to-face with him this past season and work with such a warm-hearted person was one of the most rewarding experiences in my time as a coxswain, and it made practice every day that much more enjoyable. Ben is one of those people where the longer you know them, the more you like them. It’s taken me a while to realize just how low-key funny, intelligent, and generally kind Ben can be. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a candid shot of Ben simultaneously scooping himself some ice cream and outwitting one of the other rowers, as only someone as skilled as Ben can accomplish such a task. It’s funny how you can despise Ben for being right all the time but still want a big hug from him… kind of confusing but makes sense when you figure out that he gives the best hugs. And nothing is more hilarious than the rare times where he is indeed wrong, because watching him throw a mini-tantrum or make the excuse that “English isn’t his first language” never gets old. #germanpride
				</p>
				<p>
					I love that we both love to be right all the time, I love how much we both hate losing, and I love how I know I can always count on you to be there. Thank you for being one of my best friends.

			<div class="scrim">
				<h3>Nich Lee Parker</h3>
				<h4>Head Coach</h4>
				<p>
					This is Nich, and he is the best coach I could have ever hoped for. One time sophomore year, Nich was chatting with the coxswains and brought up the fact that he was a millennial like us. I think I may have laughed out loud at the time, but he was absolutely right. A millennial, according to Wikipedia, is anyone born from the early 1980s to around 2000. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I mention this fact because Nich brings the best qualities of a millennial to the table as a coach. When we underperform as a crew, Nich blames himself first before he places the fault on any of us. When he makes a coaching decision, he is transparent in his thought process and has the research to back it up. When he knows that a certain aspect of coaching is not his forte, he brings in other people whom he knows will do a better job. If he were a company, he’d be a startup: open-sourced and always innovating. 
				</p>
				<p>
					But the one thing I am absolutely most grateful for having Nich as a coach is his investment in getting to know his athletes on a personal level, and I honestly believe that it made all the difference. In the days leading up to the national championship, Nich, knowing all of the personal obstacles each of us had overcome in our individual experiences, asked us to tap into this strength to find that last bit of speed we needed to win. Though cheesy in its strategy, only a coach who had taken the time to understand his players could have asked for such a thing and see it through to be effective. Needless to say, it worked.
				</p>
				<p>
					Champagne in his left hand and his phone in his right, this is how I will always remember Nich. Someone once said that the best coaches don’t just make winners at the sport: they make winners at life. I’m sure the nine of us will do our best not to be total losers.
